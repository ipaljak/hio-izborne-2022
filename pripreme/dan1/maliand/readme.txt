input:
space separated integers n, k, l
1 <= n <= 500000, 0 <= k, l <= n

output:
1st line: min max popcount of bitwise AND of two rotations of binary strings of length n containing k, l ones respectively
2nd line: 1st binary string (without spaces)
3rd line: 2nd binary string (without spaces)

subtasks:
1) 1 <= n <= 13
2) 1 <= n <= 5000
3) no additional constraints
